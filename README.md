## Welcome!

This platform contains all the exercises you'll cover during your 9 weeks at [Le Wagon, the French innovative Coding School](http://www.lewagon.com), welcome aboard!

## General overview

Our program has 7 modules

1. `Setup`: a small module of 1 day (the first one) to setup your workstation.

2. `Ruby`: learn fundamental concepts shared by all programming languages: variables, methods, loops, conditional statements, iterators, regular expressions,  file parsing,... Work on cool challenges with your buddies & practice on real-life examples (playing with APIs, scraping HTML, storing data in CSV files).

3. `OOP`: learn the basics of [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (Object-Oriented programming). OK, you now know how to build little programs in ruby... congrats! But wait, what if you want to build more advanced software like a restaurant booking platform, a car rental system, a social network, etc. Can you handle it with a 10000-line ruby file and dozens of methods? No, of course not, for that you need to **structure your program into different objects**, each one having a precise role to play (UI, database connection, controller logic). Learn how to structure your programs with objects and build your first MVC apps. It's one of the most important modules of the program. If you embrace it fully, then Rails will be easy as pie.

4. `Database & ActiveRecord`: At this stage you're a software engineer in a way. Not only do you know how to write smart algorithms in ruby, but you can structure your code to build more advanced programs using OOP patterns. But how do you store your data? The software you can build is amazing (no doubt about it) but it lacks **permanence** and can't store data. Let's speak about relational databases, learn to draw database schemes on a sheet of paper and to ask for records to your DB using **SQL queries**. Grrrr, configuring a connection to the database, writing raw SQL queries, re-formatting data into ruby objects, all these steps are so annoying... Why can't we use a ruby library with objects doing the job for us? Here comes Active Record, an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) to plug our ruby objects to the database. Active Record will be one of the core blocks in Rails.

5. `Front-end`: you really know a lot of stuff at this point and you can code well-structured, persistent & smart software. But the problem is... the interface. It's still our good old terminal. Wouldn't it be great to play with a nicer interface such as a HTML file with nice CSS design and JS animations? Let's learn about HTML, CSS & get the best practices in web-design (e.g. learning positioning & layout techniques in CSS + very recent stuff like flexbox & CSS animations). Then, we'll teach you how to use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), a nice CSS/JS library to save time when prototyping web-apps. Le Wagon's front end module is very dense, and you'll quickly jump to more advanced stuff such as ERB templates & SASS code, plus you'll play with Middleman: a very cool front end framework. Very professional stuff here! In the second part of the front end module, we'll see the basics of javascript and jQuery to play with the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) and listen to events on web pages. After that, we'll move to AJAX, this technology to make HTTP requests in Javascript. Using that, we will work on some awesome challenges playing with various APIs (Trello, Slack, Facebook, etc.) and defining webhooks ourselves to automate tasks.

6. `Rails`: Time to put all our skills together and move to Rails. No big deal here, we already know most of it. We know DB and ActiveRecord, we are ruby experts, we've played with dozens of gems, we already have good skills in front end development AND we've seen templating and SASS thanks to Middleman! The first Rails week will teach you all the core notions of the frameworks (routing, controllers, models, views). During the second week, **you'll code Airbnb from scratch in 5 days**. You'll work in teams and you'll learn to collaborate on Github using pull requests. You'll learn a lot from this experience, and you'll create your first real professional web-appliction deployed on Heroku.

7. `Projects`: This is the moment of truth! Let's code your own project during the 2 last weeks and build an awesome product!

## Typical day

- **9h00-10h30**: morning lecture by the lead-coach with lots of live-demo to help you understand the concepts using practical examples.
- **10h30-12h30**: pair-programming session, work on the challenges & push your attempts.
- **14h00-17h30**: finish your challenges of the day with your buddy.
-  **17h30-19h00**: "live-code session". A teacher (or sometimes a motivated student) chooses an interesting challenge of the day, or invents a new one. Then he will code the solution **from scratch** in front of the class on the projector. Doing so, he should interact with the class and ask them what to do. One of the most important moments of the day, don't miss it!

Every day, there's 5 to 10 different challenges with their own test suite, and additional optional exercises for the fastest among you.
