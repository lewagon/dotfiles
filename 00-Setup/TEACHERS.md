## 9 AM - 9:30 AM
Students' welcoming with pastries and coffee

## 9:30 AM - 10:15 AM

The manager should introduce the 9 week program and its philosophy, then detail the 9 weeks, the typical week, the typical day.

### Program philosophy

1. Standard computer science courses are boring because they don't focus on building products. Le Wagon has a different approach mixing hard and soft skills. You will realize that building a product with code is fascinating because it requires several skills

- Product-oriented vision
- Engineering and software architecture
- Design
- UX
- Good writing skills for content

2. Le Wagon is a technical accelerator focused on web development:

- You will tackle in 9 weeks what students learn in 2 years in "regular" CS degree (often during their last year)
- At the end you'll be able to prototype any web product
- It will be very hard but trust us, 13,000+ students had gone throught the same steps!

_Ask students who among them wants to be a developer, who wants to found a startup, who has no idea yet?_

### Calendar overview

Project the calendar on the screen to go through the program with the class, week after week.

#### First 3 weeks - DISCLAIMER

- The first 3 weeks are **hard**. Only algo / software architecture
- The equivalent of an entire year in coding schools
- You will struggle, you may doubt, wonder where we're heading
- Just hold on, stay motivated and trust us: 13,000+ former students have experienced the program
- It works, so at this point, **trust us** and fight for it!

#### Monday (Week 1) - Setup
- Special day, we'll focus on your machines setup, you'll go home with pimped workstations ready for the next 9 weeks!

#### Tuesday -> Friday (Week 1) - Ruby Core
- Ruby core program. Fundamentals. Elementary blocks. Scripts in 1 or 2 files, we'll run them from the terminal.
- Fast pace, a lot of information, you might feel on the verge of exploding

#### Monday -> Tuesday (Week 2) - Ruby ReBoot
- We'll split the class in two groups after the morning lecture.
- There will be a **reboot** group for those who want to have a second pass on the fundamentals

#### Wednesday (Week 2) -> Wednesday (Week 3) - Building Softwares
- When your program grows, you won't keep 2000 lines of code in one big file, it's impossible to maintain.
- Instead, you'll need to **organize** your code and split it in different files.
- That's what Software architecture is.
- Also very hard, you'll build entire software in two days, still in the terminal, **hang on 😊**

#### Thursday (Week 3) -> Tuesday (Week 4) - Database
- Now that you know how to build software, you need to learn how to save **data**.
- Database, SQL, you'll find it easier, the pace slows down a little at this point.

#### Wednesday (Week 4) -> Thursday (Week 5) - Front-end
- What's missing now? A proper interface. We'll replace the terminal by a web browser.
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, less painful, and more graphical, good way to express your creativity, fresh air for your minds.
- Monday night: you'll get to pitch a product, vote for your favorite products and join a team.
- A couple of days on JavaScript at the end.
- At this time you'll have nice static websites online 😊

#### Friday (Week 5) - Project Day
- No code
- Product day, you will prototype your ideas in team of 3 or 4 students.
- Team up with people you'll get along with!
- Choose **above all** a cool and interesting project (not a 10000th market place...). You are here to have fun and learn a maximum.

#### Monday - Friday (Week 6) - Rails basics
- One Rails app a day!
- Assemble all the pieces of the puzzle.
- You'll get the big picture on why we learnt all those blocks.
- At this time you'll have real websites with a back-end deployed online.

#### Monday - Friday (Week 7) - Airbnb week
- Airbnb clone! (no flats allowed).
- Team up with your project buddies.
- Collaborate on GitHub.
- Make mistakes you won't make again during the Project's weeks 😊

#### Monday (Week 8) - Friday (Week 9) - Project Weeks
- Projects!
- Same teams as Airbnb's week
- Make beautiful products!
- No marketplaces 😊
- Enjoy yourselves!

### Typical week overview (teacher)
- We'll work everyday (from Monday to Friday), **including holidays**.
- _Paris_ yoga lessons with our yoga teacher **Claire** (let her introduce herself) on Wednesdays (4:30 - 5:30 PM) & Fridays (12 PM - 1 PM)
  - Yoga lessons are **strongly recommended** to relax from long hours focusing on your screens
  - You'll come back with a fresh and reloaded mind, and you'll be **more productive**!
  - Yoga and Code get along pretty well! 😊
- _Paris_ apero-talks on Thursdays (7 PM) organized by **Edouard** & **Anouk** (let them introduce themselves and mention upcoming events)
  - **You** get to run the interview of a guest (CEOs, actors of the Tech scene, entrepreneurs...)
  - One "animator" sits next to our guest and leads the interview - prepare an agenda
  - Other students prepare questions
  - ~45 minutes "formal" interview
  - Informal, friendly talk around drinks

### Typical day overview (teacher)
- **9 AM - 10:30 AM**: Morning lecture in the classroom. Quite intense. Don't be late, the lecture starts at 9 AM **sharp**, with or without you!
- **10:30 AM - 5:00 PM**:
  - Fullstack-Challenges on Kitt (the exercises platform we'll show you later) with your buddy. Take enough time with your buddy to read the exercise's README from top to bottom, discuss it to be sure it's properly understood, and share ideas on how to complete the exercise before you start coding.
  - Usually everyone takes a lunch break around 1 PM, but you can take it whenever you want (Teaching Assistants often have lunch around 1 PM 😉
  - _Paris_ Introduce Le Wagon [tips](https://github.com/lewagon/tips/blob/master/paris.geojson), mention restaurants around
- **5 PM - 6 PM**: Livecode. You'll gather in the classroom with the teacher and we'll work together on a brand new exercise. You'll code from scratch, guided by the class and teacher, the idea is to have an interactive session where everyone's involved.
- **7 PM**:
  - You've reached the end of the day! Get to know each others!
  - Back home, don't code (your brains need to **rest**), but take a few minutes to read next day's lecture (you can also play flashcards, we'll show you later)

### Any questions?

## 10:30 AM - 1 PM: Setup

### Setup lecture - 10:15am (15 min)

### Student validation (end of morning setup)

At the end of the setup, students will signin on [Kitt](https://kitt.lewagon.org/onboarding) and complete their profile. Then:

- Manager should approve them on his Slack channel
- Manager should **check that students belong to their batch before approving them**. Sometimes, several cities start the same day, and students may choose the wrong batch.
- After this validation, students will receive 2 mails to join Le Wagon on GitHub and on Slack.

## 1 PM - 2 PM: Lunch time
- Tell students to be back at 2 PM sharp for the first (short) lectures

## 2 PM - 3:15 PM
