## Guidelines

This challenge should take you **45 minutes 🕒**. You should finish it and start brainstorming on the next challenge before lunch!

1. Just like the first exercise, start by writing the pseudo-code with the teacher as a live-code 💻.
2. Spend 20 minutes on your own to try to figure out the solution.
3. Then let's correct it together! 💻

## Setup

Let's create a folder for this new challenge:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/reboot
mkdir horse-race
cd horse-race
touch interface.rb
```

Again let's start with the interface. It's more intuitive.

## Pseudo-code

How should your program work when your launch it? Write the pseudo code!


```ruby
# interface.rb

# Pseudo-code:
# 1. Print welcome
# 2. Get horses 🐴
# 3. Get user's bet
# 4. Run the race 🐴
# 5. Print results
```

Each step above is too general, so **try to build it out in a bit more detail**.


## Make your computer speak :)

Let's pimp our program and make our computer speak! For that you can use `say`. That is pretty cool 😊 Be creative and build custom messages 🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴
