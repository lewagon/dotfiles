## Projects

Nearly there - keep pushing!

It's time to do some technical setups to check that everything is working correctly.

#### Product Checklist
Please note: To release the checklist panel in your [product's page](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products), enter your domain name in your Tech Specs panel.

At this point, your product should be shaping up! But we want to make sure it's all set up so that it looks really legit when you share it around to all your family, friends & future employers 😁

So, it's time to perform some sanity checks:
- [Your app is up](https://github.com/lewagon/product/blob/master/checklist/01_your_app_is_up.md)
- [Naked domain is redirected to www](https://github.com/lewagon/product/blob/master/checklist/02_naked_domain_is_redirected_to_www.md)
- [Title tag is set](https://github.com/lewagon/product/blob/master/checklist/03_title_tag_is_set.md)
- [Favicon tag is set](https://github.com/lewagon/product/blob/master/checklist/04_favicon_tag_is_set.md)
- [Open Graph meta tags are properly set](https://github.com/lewagon/product/blob/master/checklist/05_og_meta_tags_are_properly_set.md)
- [404 and 500 pages are customized](https://github.com/lewagon/product/blob/master/checklist/06_404_and_500_pages_are_customized.md)
- [og:image has the right dimensions](https://github.com/lewagon/product/blob/master/checklist/07_og_image_has_the_right_dimensions.md)

#### Progressive Web App Setup

If your product is for mobile, it's time to set up something called a PWA. Basically, the goal is to mimic a native mobile app and make the UX more comfortable on mobile. This is done by adding a shortcut to your app from the user's homescreen and displaying the app in full screen. To set this up, please follow [this tutorial](https://kitt.lewagon.com/knowledge/tutorials/from_web_app_to_pwa) and put in a ticket if you have any trouble.
