## Projects

If your frontend could use some work, now is the time to give it the love and attention it deserves.

#### Frontend

- Look back on the frontend feedbacks from your intermediate demo, and implement them.
- Call in some extra support if needed, and get a TA to give you additional feedback on ways to improve.
- Go to your favorite apps & websites and pay attention to the small details they use to elevate their design... and then steal like an artist (can you say `browser inspector`?) and implement it in your own design.
- If it's a mobile app, make sure you're checking often that everything is looking good and is in it's correct place on the mobile browser.
