## Background & Objectives

Now you are familiar with migrations and models, it's time for a real-life scenario.
How do you test if your database works, if you don't have any **data**?
To do this, we need to create a bunch of data that we can use to bootstrap our database. It's called a `seed`.

## Setup

We will use the [faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker) gem to generate `Post` attributes.
But first you have to install it:

```bash
gem install faker
```

Here is a useful command to `drop` your database, `recreate` it, `migrate` the schema and `seed` it.
It'll save you a lot of time while building your seed, and you'll use it a lot in project weeks, so get used to it!

```bash
rake db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

Once you have done the seed, you can look at your rows you just inserted with the `rake db:seed` using traditional SQL queries:

```bash
sqlite3 db/development.sqlite3
sqlite> .mode columns
sqlite> .headers on
sqlite> SELECT * FROM posts;
```

## Specs

Open the `db/seeds.rb` file and write some code to insert 100 posts, using
fake data generated by the [`faker`](https://github.com/stympy/faker) gem. 
There are a ton of fun faker options in there, so get creative 😊.
