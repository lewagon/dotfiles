The Front-end module has 7 days + 1 project-day to start preparing your final projects.

## `01 HTML & CSS`

You'll cover a lot of HTML & CSS concepts in the next few days, such as:

- HTML skeleton and common tags (in `<head>` and `<body>`)
- CSS simple and advanced selectors
- Web-design resources for fonts & colors (google fonts, fontawesome, etc.)

The objective of this day is to build [your profile page](https://papillard.github.io/my-profile/) and put it online using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## `02 CSS Components`

We will go a bit further and make you code your own CSS component library. The objectives are:

- Improve the way you organize and store components
- Re-code your [own UI Kit](https://uikit.lewagon.com)

**Take-away**: Once you've finished, you'll be able to take HTML/CSS code directly from [Le Wagon UI Kit](https://uikit.lewagon.com).

## `03 Bootstrap, Grids & Layouts`

We will first have a look at the CSS framework Bootstrap and everything it gives us then we will explore the different ways to structure your webpages by looking at the Bootstrap grid, flexboxes for simple layouts and CSS grid for more complex ones. The objectives at the end of the day are:

- For rich components, we've now built our own CSS library
- For standard ones, let's not re-invent the wheel! We'll be using built-in Bootstrap classes
- Using the Bootstrap grid for funtional responsive layouts
- Using flexboxes for horizontal or vertical alginment of components
- Using CSS grid to build mosaic of cards

## `04 JavaScript Basics`

First day of the JavaScript submodule! JavaScript is THE programming language that is understood by browsers. It's still a programming language, like Ruby, with types, variables, functions etc. But the syntax in JavaScript is different from Ruby's, so you need to familiarise with it.

For today's challenges, we'll leave the browser and go back to the terminal to play with algorithmics in JavaScript!

Then, instead of the live-code it's Pitch Night! You will have 5 minutes to pitch your idea in front of the class. Have a look at `Front-End/Bootstrap/Pitch-Preparation` if you want a head-start on preparing.

## `05 DOM & Events`

Now that we picked up the syntax, let's go back to the browser and use JavaScript as a front-end language. On this day, we will introduce the DOM – how the browser processes the HTML webpage – and how we can use JavaScript to interact with it.

We will also have a look at the different user events we can listen to with JavaScript in order to build highly dynamic interfaces.

## `06 HTTP & AJAX`

Let's rehearse the basics of the Web with HTTP requests / response cycles.

We will discover how to fetch content dynamically using AJAX and JavaScript without having to reload the page.

## `07 JavaScript Plugins`

In this lecture, we will download external JavaScript packages with **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)** and use them in our interfaces. We'll also see how to organise our code in several files in a front-end app.

## `08 Product Design Sprint`

This is a special day. **No coding 😱, just prototyping and Product design 🖌🖍📝**. The objective is to:

- Prototype your project with your team
- Make a demo of your project in front of the class as if you had coded it.
