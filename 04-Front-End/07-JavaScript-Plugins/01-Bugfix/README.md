## Background & Objectives

A simple challenge to start the day! This morning you saw how to work with multiple files in a front-end project. You'll find two JavaScript files in the `lib` folder. The code is currently broken, and your job is to fix it.

## Specs

Launch your local server with:

```bash
rake webpack
```

Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser, open your console and read the error message.

Found what's missing? Go ahead and fix it! When it's done you should see a pretty familiar logo displayed in your Browser ;)
