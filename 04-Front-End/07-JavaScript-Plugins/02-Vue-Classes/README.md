## Background & Objectives

You've spent quite some time learning OOP concept in Ruby at the beginning of the bootcamp (Cookbook, anyone?).

But JavaScript is also an Object Oriented Programming language, and since 2015 (ES6), it supports [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes).

In this small challenge, you'll be introduced to ES6 classes.

## Getting Started: JavaScript Classes

You can run the tests of this small Node exercise with the good ol' rake:

```bash
rake
```

There are 3 tests you need to turn green. Everything you need to know is on [this MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes). We want you to implement the `User` class in the `lib/user.js` file with:

- A `firstName` instance variable
- A `lastName` instance variable
- Both instance variables are initialized by the `constructor`
- A `fullName()` instance method returning the concatenated first and last name

That's 7 lines of JS code, think about how you did Object Oriented Programming in Ruby, the concepts are exactly the same here!
