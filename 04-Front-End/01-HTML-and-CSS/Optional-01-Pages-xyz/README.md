## Getting started

For this challenge, we are giving you some creative freedom 🤓. Go to [pages.xyz](https://www.pages.xyz/)(a website created by an alumnus of Le Wagon) and find a page that you find cool, but not somthing that looks **too** complicated 😉.

## Background & Objectives

Once you have found a page that you like, have a go at trying to recreate it!
