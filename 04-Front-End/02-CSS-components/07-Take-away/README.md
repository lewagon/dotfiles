## Your CSS future is bright!

Congratulations for today, it was a very important day in your CSS career.

From now on:

- You can use the [Le Wagon components library](http://lewagon.github.io/ui-components/) without recoding it every time 😊
- Remember, always **take time to think about your HTML stucture** (wrapper, container, inside components, etc.). It's **90% of the work**. Once you've done that, you just need to re-use components and make some small CSS adjustments.
